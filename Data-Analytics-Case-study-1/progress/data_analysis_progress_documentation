The three main question that needs to be answered:
  * 1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

    3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Stakeholders:  
  - The director of marketing,Lily Moreno (believes maximizing the number of annual memberships to achieve better success. Sets a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.) 
  - Cyclistic marketing analytics team( design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.)
  - Cyclistic executive team(approve data analysis team's recommendations.)


Phase 1: ASK

  This is the phase where asking questions to understand the main goal/problem need to be solved, how the big picture should look like.

  Q What is the problem you are trying to solve? 
  A The problem is how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

  Q How can your insights drive business decisions?
  A I shall provide data to prove what is the different in between and what might be the most efficient way to transform casual riders to annual members.

--- 
Final output of this phase: 
A clear statement of the business task, is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

Phase 2: Prepare

  Get the data ready for the rest of the analysis process.

  Q Where is your data located?
  A I've downloaded dataset from cloud, and files are stored in a same folder on my laptop.

  Q How is the data organized?
  A The data was organized by monthly since 2020 Q2, before that, it was organized quaterly. 

  Q Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data?
  A As we can see in the license agreement<https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement>, the city of Chicago has permitted Bikeshare to make certain Divvy system data available to the public while operating the Divvy system. Since the system was owned by the city of Chicago, there must be a certain level of credibility in this data. 

--- 
Final output of this phase: 
A description of all data sources used, the dataset is public to anyone with accessible link<https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>. Data was collected from the city of Chicago's system, which was operated by a third party.

Phase 3: Process

  Process your data for the analysis process.

  Q What tools are you choosing and why?
  A I choose to process data with R studio, because this is the new skill I want to practice more. 

  Q What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?
  A By using the colnames() function, I get to check whether there is any column that should be exclude for analysis. By using the table() function in R, I get to check whether the collected data are what I was expecting.

  Q How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?
  A I get to check the whole data set with str/colnames to make sure data types are ready for further analysis process. Checking data type with is.numeric function to make sure the data are ready for calculation.

--- 
Final output of this phase: 
Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data, all process are being recorded in the R file.

Phase 4: Analyze

  Start putting data to work.

  Q How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?
  A Focus on the main question, which is we're looking for the difference in between member riders and casual riders, so we get to seperate data into two main groupd for comparison, member riders versus casual riders. Then we start analyze with the data we have in the dataset.

  Q Has your data been properly formatted?
  A Yes, the data has been properly formatted, so they could be combine into one dataset. Moreover, in the porcess of analysis, data will need to be calculated, it's better to format data before calculations.

  Q What surprises did you discover in the data?
  A It was interesting to discover that casual riders spend more riding time and less number of rides than member riders. 

--- 
Final output of this phase: 
A summary of your analysis, according to the final result, member riders have higher rates in number of rides. Although casual riders have lower rates in number of rides, their average duration were mostly twice or more than member riders.

Phase 5: Share

  Create visualizations to share findings. 

--- 
Final output of this phase: 
Supporting visualizations and key findings, the results will be present with Powerpoint, with data visualization images.
---



Phase 6: Act
  Create visualizations to share findings.

--- 
Final output of this phase: 
Your top three recommendations based on your analysis, were written in the PowerPoint presentation.
