# data_analysis_capstone_project

To complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, it is a must to finish a capstone project. 
The capstone project I choose to complete is a case study about a fiction company, named Cyclistic. 



## About the case study:

Cyclistic is a company that provides bike sharing service.
The director of marketing in Cyclistic believes by increasing the numbers of member could bring the business to future success. 

The marketing analyst team needs to better understand...
- How annual members and casual riders differ?
- Why casual riders would buy a membership?
- How digital media could affect their marketing tactics?

I am working as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team, ***my main responsibility is to discover and understand what is the main difference between members and casual riders.***
Later after the main difference is discovered, the report should include the top three recommendations based on analysis.




## About the directories:

The data analysis progress has been catogorized into 6 steps: ***Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act***.
1. **ASK**, ask questions to understand what is the main problem the analysis is suppose to answered.
2. **PREPARE**, collect data from resources, identify whether bias exist or any issue with credibility with the collected data.
3. **PROCESS**, clean data and transform data type for further analysis.
4. **ANALYZE**, dive into data analysis, find trends or relationships within the cleaned data.
5. **SHARE**, create data viz to share data findings, tell the story with presentation.
6. **ACT**, the next step recommendation based on the findings.

There are 2 folders, one of it contains the \<final reports> (which covers the ***SHARE*** and ***ACT*** phase of data analysis). 
The another one \<progress> includes the documentation of my analyzing progress, R script that I used to analyze data, and the data viz that R script produced.



## Sneak peek of the conclusion:

### There are two main difference between casual riders and members:

1. Casual riders has a lower numbers of ride than members.
2. Casual riders has longer riding durations than members.

### And these two main difference builds up the 3 recommendations to achieve the business goal of this case study, convert causl riders to members:

1. Encourage casual riders to ride more often(increase numbers of ride), create a marketing program for them, they get to convert to members once they've completed riding missions.
2. Since the numbers of ride and riding durations both increases during weekend, suggest to rise the selling price of one time pass during weekend, which might trigger casual members start consider to join membership.
3. Set limitation for one-time/day pass tickets, and provide re-marketing discount to casual riders. The limitation will created inconvenience, whereas providing discounts will increase their interest to join membership.



Hope you enjoy the exploration like I did!
